## About Me

I am a recent graduate with a Master's in [Intelligent Field Robotic Systems (IFRoS)](https://ifrosmaster.org/) from the Erasmus Mundus program. My academic journey culminated in a master's thesis at the [Laboratory for Robotics and Intelligent Control Systems (LARICS)](https://larics.fer.hr/) at the University of Zagreb, where I focused on connectivity maintenance of ad-hoc UAV networks for multi-robot missions.

I hold an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on robotics and computer vision, from [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/) in 2022.

With a strong background in autonomous systems, multi-robot systems, and computer vision, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and software tools, including ROS/ROS 2, Gazebo, MATLAB, Python, and C++.
